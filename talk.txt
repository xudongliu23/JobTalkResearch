P1:
Thank you Dr. XX for the introduction.
Thank you all very much for coming.
My name is Xudong Liu.
I am a PhD candidate in CS from UK.
Today my talk is about my research work on preference trees over
combinatorial domains.

P2:
Why are preferences important?  Why do we care about preferences?
Well, preferences are everywhere.
People give ratings to items online, such as a movie or a wireless mouse.
The ratings are essentially people's preferences.
Usually the higher the score or the more stars, the more preferred is the item.
Sometimes our preferences are taken into account before we even
realize it.  For instance, google search and google scholar customize
the search results, so that even for the same search key words, different
users may end up with different lists of webpage links.
On the social scale, we cast our votes in an election where a winning candidate,
e.g., a representative, or a president, needs to be selected.
The votes are basically preferences over a set of candidates.

P3:
Now that we saw that preferences are everywhere and are important.
We need to know how people may describe preferences so that we,
as computer scientists, can express them mathematically, so that
computers will be able to model, learn and reason with preferences.
Let us look at these two cars.  On the left, we have a gray Honda minivan;
on the right, we have a blue VW sedan.  Let's call them simply Car1 and Car2.
Now we may say preferences over these two cars, such as I prefer
Car1 to Car2, I like Car1 and Car2 equally, or because of incomplete information
about them I cannot decide my preference.
However, in practice, this incomparability barely is the case; because one
is able to tell the order once all the information needed is gathered.

P4:
In general, we express preferences either quantitatively or qualitatively.
In the quantitative approach, we assign numeric values to the objects,
and they are ordered based on the ordering of real numbers.
There, we typically design utility functions that maps the domains of
attributes to numbers.  E.g., for the BodyType attribute we may assign 5 to
minivan and 8 to sedan, for the Color attribute we may give 6 to gray and 7 
blue, etc.  Eventually, we collect the total and thus the preference follows.
However, in many cases, it is difficulty to come up with accurate
utility functions and it can be too much work for complex domains that contain
too many values to consider.
This is when we resort to yet another approach of describing preferences, namely,
qualitative approach.  Here, we focus on the relative desirability of properties of the
cars.  For instance, I may specify that I prefer minivans to sedans; that is,
the car being a minivan is a more desired property than it being a sedan.
Sometimes, these qualitative preference statements are conditional.
E.g., if I am considering sedan cars, I prefer blue ones to gray ones;
if I am considering minivans, I like gray more than blue; etc.
The idea here is that, from not very many qualitative preference statements, 
we want to build a preference model that could order all cars in the given domain.
My research was mostly about qualitative preferences.
