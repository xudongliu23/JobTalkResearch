Preferences are everywhere in various forms, such as movie ratings, favorite ice cream flavors,
and electoral ballots over candidates.
In this talk, I will discuss my research work on qualitative preference models, especially
tree-like preference models, over combinatorial domains that are collections of 
objects -- often too many to order.
An example combinatorial domain is a set of cars, characterized by a set of attributes (e.g., color)
and their values (e.g., white, black, and blue).
A car is then represented by a vector of attribute values.
I will show the theoretic and practical results we obtained on research problems in
preference modeling, learning and reasoning over combinatorial domains.
I will conclude with future research directions and possible undergraduate research projects.
